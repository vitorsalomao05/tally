    q: "Is Houdini really installable today?",

  },
  {
    q: "Do my credentials ever leave my Mac?",
    a: "No. There is no Houdini account and no Houdini server. Houdini reads the credential already on your machine — your Claude Code OAuth token, or a claude.ai session you grant once — and calls the provider directly from your Mac. Tokens stay in your Keychain.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which AI providers does it work with?",
    a: "Claude Pro and Max work today — your limits, reset timers, and extra-usage spend. Houdini is Claude-first; more providers can come as they open up, and it never shows a gauge it can't honestly fill.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does it read my Claude usage?",
    a: "If you use Claude Code, Houdini reuses its OAuth token from the Keychain — zero new logins. Otherwise you sign in to claude.ai once in a native window and Houdini keeps the session in your Keychain. It then calls the same usage endpoint the official tools do.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it really refresh every 60 seconds?",
    a: "Yes — a true 60-second timer, in the menu bar and the desktop widget alike, so the headline number is always current.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost?",
    a: "Nothing. Houdini is free and open-source. Read every line before you run it — the installer is pinned to a release tag and verifies checksums before touching your disk.",
  },
  {
    q: "macOS requirements?",
    a: "macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer on Apple Silicon. No Intel build is shipped.",
  },
];
