# CONTEXT.md — Houdini (product & current state)

> The *why* and *what* behind Houdini. Pairs with [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (how we work)
> and [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) (what's next). Last framed: 2026-07-01.

## Product overview

Houdini is a **local-first macOS app** (macOS 14+, Apple Silicon) that reveals a user's
**AI usage and spend**. It surfaces the same data two co-equal ways:

- **Menu bar** — your tightest limit, always visible; popover with full detail. ~60s refresh.
- **Desktop widget** — the same gauges on the wallpaper as a draggable, resizable glass
  panel (SwiftUI in an `NSPanel`), native to the app. ~60s refresh.

**Claude (Pro/Max) is live today**: 5-hour and weekly limits, reset timers, and any
extra-usage spend, refreshed about every 60 seconds. **OpenAI, Google Gemini, and the
Anthropic Console are on the roadmap** (see `PROVIDERS.md` / `ROADMAP.md`).

The core mechanism: Houdini reads the user's *existing* credential (Keychain OAuth token
or session cookie) and calls each provider's **JSON usage endpoint directly** — no bundled
browser, no scraping (a browser-scrape adapter survives only as a last-resort fallback).

## Positioning

- **Lead pitch:** *"See your Claude spend at a glance, right from your Mac's menu bar."*
- **Broader promise:** reveal your AI usage and spend, local-first, across providers.
- **Audience:** Mac developers and AI power users — especially Claude Pro/Max and Claude
  Code users — who want a fast, practical, always-visible read on consumption.
- **Name:** "Houdini" = the number *revealed*, not hidden.

## Distribution & pricing

- **100% free and open source.** No account, no payment, no server.
- **Primary conversion action = install.** Users land on **houdini.salomao.org** and run
  the one-liner, which downloads the ad-hoc-signed `Houdini.app` + `houdini` CLI from a
  **pinned Release**, **verifies SHA-256**, and installs **without `sudo`** and **without
  a Gatekeeper prompt** (app → `~/Applications`, CLI → `~/.local/bin`). Safe to re-run;
  offers but never forces launch-at-login.
- Current release: **v0.4.0**.

## Trust & security posture (a first-class selling point)

- Credentials **never leave the device** — tokens/cookies stay in the macOS **Keychain**.
- **There is no Houdini server.** Requests go straight from the user's Mac to each
  provider's own endpoint.
- Because the app touches logins, the site carries a **dedicated trust/privacy section**.
- Messaging leads with: **safe by design, robust local data handling, no compromise.**
- Principle for the future: any elevated permission (e.g. the browser-scrape fallback)
  must be provably secure and least-privilege before it ships.

## Current state (2026-07-01)

**App**
- Claude provider is **live** (v0.4.0). It reads the **Claude Code OAuth token in
  Keychain** *or* a **claude.ai session cookie**.
- **Claude auth is deliberately KEPT READ-ONLY and its subscription-auth expansion is FROZEN**
  (see **ADR-012**, decided 2026-07-01). Both paths use the user's *existing* on-device
  credential; Anthropic's Consumer Terms restrict third-party use of subscription OAuth/cookies,
  so Houdini stays read-only and adds **no** refresh, first-run PKCE, or cookie-hardening. P1
  shipped only slice (a) (broadened discovery of an existing credential); a user with **no**
  Claude Code credential anywhere is **out of scope by decision**.
- Menu bar + native desktop widget ship inside one app. A Notification Center WidgetKit
  widget exists in `apps/widget` but is intentionally **not advertised** (ADR-002).

**Site** (`site/`, Astro + Tailwind, live at houdini.salomao.org)
- Live but **not fully polished**. Target is a **100% clean site with zero visual
  clutter/pollution** and strong accessibility.
- **Live visual + accessibility audit DONE 2026-07-01** (Claude in Chrome; full report at
  `conductor/audits/2026-07-01-site-audit.md`). It found the site already calm/low-clutter and
  mostly WCAG-AA clean. The four ToS-independent quick-wins have **shipped** (commit `78e2bf3`):
  the product screenshot now shows on mobile, the curl one-liner is fully readable, footer +
  terminal-label contrast pass AA, and decorative SVGs are confirmed `aria-hidden` — so the site
  now passes AA on the audited items and shows the product shot on mobile. Two findings were
  ToS-gated and intentionally deferred (see **ADR-012**): the hero H1 is kept generic, and an
  explicit trust sentence is left optional.

## Design direction

Minimalist and calm: generous whitespace, one clear install CTA, legible typography, a
real product screenshot/demo, and a distinct trust/privacy section. Accessible by default
(WCAG 2.1 AA). Respect the no-separate-branding decision for menu bar vs desktop widget.

## Priorities (app-first) & why

1. **Login refactor — DECIDED / CAPPED (ADR-012).** The Claude integration stays **read-only**
   on the user's existing credential and its subscription-auth expansion is **frozen**; slice (a)
   (broadened discovery) shipped, and a user with no Claude Code credential anywhere is out of
   scope by decision. Active focus has moved to #2.
2. **Widget accessibility + polish** — make the core surfaces (menu bar + desktop widget)
   genuinely polished and accessible end to end.
3. **Site polish + ongoing features** — with the app solid, drive the site to zero clutter
   and keep it evolving with new features and ideas.

## Survey findings (FRAME, resolved 2026-07-01)

- **Unified login — hypothesis CONFIRMED at the code level.** Today the app reads exactly two
  credential sources: (1) the Claude Code CLI's OAuth token, from the single Keychain item
  `service="Claude Code-credentials"` (via the `security` CLI); and (2) a claude.ai `sessionKey`
  cookie in Houdini's own Keychain item `Houdini-claude-session`, captured by a WebView login. The
  OAuth lookup is hardcoded to that one item name — no alternates, no `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
  file fallback, no refresh-token use — so a **non-CLI user has no OAuth item and is forced onto the
  cookie WebView**, which uses an ephemeral store (no reuse of the browser's existing claude.ai
  session) and a short-lived, non-refreshable cookie. Candidate fixes (broaden discovery / harden
  cookie / first-run OAuth PKCE) and the recommendation are in `BACKLOG.md` P1. *Design, don't build
  yet.*
- **Site deploy target + CI — resolved: Vercel.** Project `houdini`, deployed manually via the
  prebuilt CLI (`vercel --prod` from `site/`). No site CI in `.github/workflows/` (only the app
  release workflow lives there). `ROADMAP.md` Phase 7's "Cloudflare Pages" is stale.
- **Test coverage — resolved.** `core/` has swift-testing suites (`FetcherCoreTests`) plus a
  `houdini-selftest` runnable mirror; no automated tests in `apps/*` or `site/`.
- **Constraints:** none are hard. Everything (stack, brand, existing implementation) is
  open to change — but changes to documented decisions should update the relevant ADR
  (see the ADR-006-vs-reality flag in `CLAUDE.md`).

## Not-yet-surfaced in this doc set

- `apps/ios/` — a native iPhone app + WidgetKit scaffold (cookie auth, reuses `FetcherCore`;
  XcodeGen, not yet buildable here) exists per ADR-008 / ROADMAP Phase 9. It is a real, coherent
  scaffold, not junk — just absent from the top-of-repo layout maps until now.
