# CLAUDE.md — Houdini (operating guide for Claude Code)

> This is the **Build Conductor** operating layer for the Houdini monorepo. It tells
> Claude Code *how to work here*. For the *product & why*, see [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).
> For *what to build next*, see [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md).

## What Houdini is (one line)

A local-first **macOS app** that reveals your AI usage and spend — in the menu bar and
on the desktop. **Claude (Pro/Max) is live today**; OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic
Console are on the roadmap. No account, no server — credentials stay in the Keychain.

Pitch we lead with on the site: *"See your Claude spend at a glance, right from your
Mac's menu bar."*

## This is a monorepo

```
core/            FetcherCore Swift package (shared data layer) + `houdini` / `houdini-selftest` CLI
apps/menubar/    SwiftUI menu bar app + native desktop widget (flagship) — SPM exe wrapped by build.sh
apps/widget/     WidgetKit Notification Center widget — README-only placeholder today (unadvertised, ADR-002)
apps/ios/        Native iOS app + widget scaffold (cookie auth, XcodeGen; not yet built — ADR-008)
site/            Astro + Tailwind landing page (houdini.salomao.org; deploys via Vercel)
install.sh       one-liner installer (SHA-256-verified download from a pinned Release)
scripts/         release/init helpers — `init.sh` bootstrap; release CI is .github/workflows/release.yml
```

**Environment:** macOS 14+ / Apple Silicon. App = Swift / SwiftUI (menu bar + desktop
widget ship as one SwiftPM executable; no `.xcodeproj`, no full Xcode required — build via
`apps/menubar/build.sh`). Site = Astro 5 + Tailwind 4. Installer is pinned to a release tag
(currently `v0.4.0`). New here? Run `scripts/init.sh` to verify your toolchain and print the
repo map + real commands + the top BACKLOG item.

## Source-of-truth docs (read before changing related areas)

- `README.md` — install, core idea, providers table, repo layout, privacy posture.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design + diagram.
- `DECISIONS.md` — ADRs. **Respect these unless we explicitly revise one.**
- `PROVIDERS.md` — provider-adapter contract + per-provider specs.
- `ROADMAP.md` — phased plan.
- `CONTEXT.md` / `BACKLOG.md` — the Build Conductor product context and work queue.

## How we work (Build Conductor)

1. **FRAME** (now): interview → these three docs → repo survey → baseline commit.
2. **Build loop**: pull the top `BACKLOG.md` item → discovery-first (map current state,
   confirm assumptions) → implement in a small, reviewable change → verify → update
   `BACKLOG.md` → commit.
3. Keep `BACKLOG.md` and `CONTEXT.md` current as reality changes. Prefer proposing and
   discussing before any large rebuild — everything is open to change, but not silently.

## Current priorities (app-first — see BACKLOG for detail)

1. **P1 · Login/credential refactor** — simpler, works for *any* Claude Code user, not
   just those with the CLI OAuth token in Keychain.
2. **P2 · Widget accessibility + visual polish** — menu bar + desktop widget, end to end.
3. **P3 · Site polish + ongoing features** — get the site to *zero visual clutter*, then
   keep shipping features/ideas as requested. The site is an evolving surface, not a
   one-time deliverable.

## Guardrails (do not violate without explicit sign-off)

- **Security & privacy first.** Credentials live only in the macOS Keychain. There is no
  Houdini server and must not be one; requests go straight from the user's Mac to each
  provider's own endpoint. Never log, transmit, cache to disk, or otherwise leak tokens
  or cookies. Any *future* elevated permission (e.g. the last-resort browser-scrape
  fallback) must be provably secure and least-privilege before it ships.
- **Free & open source.** No paywalls, no account required to install or use.
- **Ruthless minimalism on the site.** Target is **zero visual clutter/pollution** and
  **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility. Every added element must earn its place.
- **Respect existing ADRs.** e.g. the site brands neither the menu bar nor the desktop
  widget separately (ADR-010/011); the Notification Center widget is not advertised
  (ADR-002, ~15 min refresh cap). Revise an ADR openly rather than contradicting it.
- **Installer integrity is sacred.** `install.sh` must keep verifying SHA-256 against
  `SHASUMS256.txt`, install without `sudo`, avoid Gatekeeper prompts, and never force
  launch-at-login. Don't weaken these claims — the site advertises them.

## Verification expectations (per change)

- **Auth changes:** test *both* the CLI-token path and the non-CLI path; confirm no
  credential ever leaves the device or hits disk/logs.
- **Any UI change (app or site):** check keyboard access, visible focus, and text
  contrast; don't regress accessibility.
- **Site changes:** re-run the live visual + accessibility audit (Claude in Chrome) and
  confirm the change moves toward zero-clutter, not away.
- **No telemetry or third-party trackers** get added to the site or app.

## Survey findings — FRAME questions resolved (2026-06-30 → 2026-07-01)

- **Site deploy target + CI** — **Vercel**, project `houdini` (`site/.vercel/project.json`),
  deployed **manually via the prebuilt CLI** (`vercel --prod` from `site/`; prebuilt output in
  `site/.vercel/output/`). **No site CI** in `.github/workflows/` — the only workflow there
  (`release.yml`) builds + publishes the macOS **app** on `v*.*.*` tags. A Vercel Git
  integration *may* also exist dashboard-side but is not provable from the repo.
  (Note: `ROADMAP.md` Phase 7 still says "Cloudflare Pages" — **stale, should be corrected**.)
- **Non-CLI login root cause** — confirmed at the code level. OAuth discovery is pinned to the
  single Keychain item `service="Claude Code-credentials"` (`core/.../ClaudeOAuthProvider.swift:45`,
  read at `ClaudeAuth.swift:37`): no alternate item names, no `~/.claude/.credentials.json` file
  fallback, no `refreshToken` use. A user without the Claude Code CLI lacks that exact item, so the
  OAuth path is impossible for them and they're forced onto the claude.ai **cookie** WebView, which
  uses an *ephemeral* store (`ClaudeLoginWindow.swift:40`) and a short-lived, non-refreshable
  cookie. Full trace + 3 candidate fixes live in `BACKLOG.md` (P1). Recommended: broaden OAuth/token
  discovery now (no ADR change), pursue a first-run OAuth PKCE flow as the durable answer.
- **Test setup** — `core/` has real tests: `FetcherCoreTests` (swift-testing / `import Testing`)
  plus a `houdini-selftest` executable that re-runs the same assertions on CommandLineTools-only
  machines (`swift test` no-ops there). **No test targets** in `apps/menubar` (smoke via built
  binary flags: `--selftest`/`--metrictest`/`--snapshot`/`--launchtest`), `apps/widget`, `apps/ios`,
  or `site/`.
- **`feature_list.json` / init script** — neither existed; **both created this pass**
  (`feature_list.json` at repo root, `scripts/init.sh`).

## Open questions / proposed doc fixes (flagged, not silently changed)

- **ADR-006 vs reality:** production ships an **ad-hoc-signed app via `install.sh` / `curl|bash`**,
  which ADR-006 demotes to a "developer-tester stopgap" in favour of a notarized DMG. Reality has
  diverged from the ADR — **revise ADR-006 (or add an ADR) openly** rather than leave the drift.
- **ROADMAP.md is stale:** Phase 7 says "Cloudflare Pages" (→ Vercel) and lists a "providers grid"
  that ADR-010/011 forbid; phase ✅ markers and "← WE ARE HERE" (Phase 1) predate the live v0.4.0 app.
- **Google Gemini** is advertised in `README.md`/`CONTEXT.md` as a planned provider but has **no
  entry in `PROVIDERS.md` or `ROADMAP.md`** — either spec it or drop the claim.
- **Übersicht** is referenced as a live surface in ADR-002/ADR-003 but was removed — historical ADR
  text, flag on next ADR revision.
